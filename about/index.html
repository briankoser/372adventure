        <p>To celebrate the <a href="http://372pages.com/">372 Pages We'll Never Get back</a> podcast finishing their 10th book, I present this 372 Pages fan-fiction role-playing game. It seemed fitting to write a story by ripping off other stories and filling up on references.
        <h1>Thanks</h1>
        <p>Thanks Conor and Mike for the podcast. It's become one of our favorite bits of media to consume together.
        <p>Thanks to the <a href="http://tableflipsyou.com">Flip the Table podcast</a>; the format of 372 Adventure is an adaptation of one of their recurring games. Aptly, Flip the Table was inspired in part by Mystery Science Theatre 3000. (The hosts riff on cheesy, weird, and obscure board games, then conclude with a game show. The podcast has ended, but I highly recommend listening through the archive; start with <a href="https://tableflipsyou.blogspot.com/2012/10/episode-13-gone-birding.html">Gone Birding!</a> or <a href="https://tableflipsyou.blogspot.com/2014/02/episode-48-mcdonalds-game.html">The McDonald's Game</a>.)
        <p>Thanks to my wife and podcast cohost Melissa, who contributed a bunch of suggestions, especially for <i>The Lair of the White Worm</i>.
        <p>Thanks to Ben De Bono of <a href="http://thescifichristian.com">The Sci-Fi Christian</a>, who turned us on to 372 Pages in the <i>Ready Player One</i> days.
        <p>And to Conor again, who <a href="http://372pages.com/episodes/372pages_008.mp3#t=01:19:47">once said</a>, <q>There's value in creating something that is more than just reciting things that came before it, or telling people what you like.</q>... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Brian Koser is a little proud that he has <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2883909057">the highest-rated review of <i>Trucking through Time</i> on Goodreads</a>. Brian Koser is a little less proud that his review of <i>Trucking through Time</i> on Goodreads is the most popular book review that he has written on Goodreads. Brian Koser has a wife Melissa Koser. Melissa Koser is also a podcaster and a reader. Brian Koser and Melissa Koser met in college. Brian Koser and Melissa Koser have three daughters: Lydia, Amber, and Penelope. Lydia Koser, Amber Koser, and Penelope Koser are good sisters. It is so good when a sister is nice to another sister, and then that sister is in turn nice to a sister. Thus nice produces nice.</figcaption>
