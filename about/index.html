        <p>Hi, I'm Brian. Among my hobbies are <a href="https://tto.koser.us">podcasting with my wife Melissa</a>, reading, and building websites.
        <p>To celebrate the 372 Pages We'll Never Get back podcast finishing their 10th book, I wrote what amounts to fan fiction. It seems fitting to present a story cribbed from other stories and geared for the reaction of, "I get that reference!"
        <p>To close another circle, the stripped-down role-playing game format I used is borrowed from the <a href="http://tableflipsyou.com">Flip the Table podcast</a>, which was inspired in part by Mystery Science Theatre 3000. (The hosts riff on cheesy, weird, and obscure board games, then conclude with a game show. The podcast has ended, but I highly recommend listening through the archive.)
        <p>The benefits to this format are that I don't have to be creative, and I don't have to be correct. You can assume any mistakes are purposeful and ironic.
        <p>Thanks Melissa
