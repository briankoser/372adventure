        <p>To celebrate the <a href="http://372pages.com/">372 Pages We'll Never Get back</a> podcast finishing their 10th book, I present this 372 Pages fan-fiction role-playing game. It seemed fitting to write a story by uncreatively borrowing from other stories and stuffing it full of references.
        <p>To close another circle, the format of the game is adapted from the <a href="http://tableflipsyou.com">Flip the Table podcast</a>, which was inspired in part by Mystery Science Theatre 3000. (The hosts riff on cheesy, weird, and obscure board games, then conclude with a game show.) The podcast has ended, but I highly recommend listening through the archive. (Start with <a href="https://tableflipsyou.blogspot.com/2012/10/episode-13-gone-birding.html">Gone Birding!</a> or <a href="https://tableflipsyou.blogspot.com/2014/02/episode-48-mcdonalds-game.html">The McDonald's Game</a>.)
        <p>Thanks Melissa
