            <h1>Prologue</h1>
            <p>I put down my corn chips and scratched myself.
            <p>It's 2044, and I'm playing "The Oasis", the world's most popular online game. The creators named it after a game in a classic '10s book, Ready Player One. Like the game in the book, you can fly spaceships around and visit virtual planets containing everything imaginable. But the real game within the game is the monthly Hunt. Each month, the game designers choose a themed group of planets and hide a key on each one. Collect all the keys and you win.
            <p>This month's contest was about to start. I finished my corn chips and put down the bag. As I stared at the screen, the subject of the new Hunt faded in to visibility:
            <p>372 Pages
            <p>What I can only describe as a Cheshire grin spread slowly over my face. Over the past few years, I had listened to every episode of the classic podcast eight times.
            <p>I watched every episode of the classic '80s show Mystery Science Theatre 3000, including the Netflix revival and the '30s VR series.
            <p>I continued to listen to Like Trees Walking, even though Dave Berge was now a cyborg. 
            <p>I memorized every riff from every movie that Rifftrax ever riffed.
            <p>I read all 29 of Conor Lastowka's published novels several times each.
            <p>I knew that Conor had appeared on Jeopardy, so I watched all 57 seasons of the show.
            <p>I convinced my drama teacher to let us put on "Ken Burns Babyfur" as a class play senior year.
            <p>I read every book on crows and mockingbirds at my local library.
            <p>I watched every 372 Pages documentary.
            <p>I even listened to all of the side projects.
            <p>The grin remained spread across my face like The Joker in the 1989 film Batman, played by Jack Nicholson. I switched my microphone on and said, "N3lson, you ready for this?"
            <p>A voice seemed to crackle over my headset. "Lord N3lson to you, crapburger!"
            <p>I shook my head, still grinning. I had never met N3lson in real life, but I instinctively knew he looked exactly like his Oasis avatar. "Then I expect the same courtesy, lamer."
            <p>N3lson laughed. "Alright, Odgen. Let's do this!"
            <p>"It's on," I whispered. "It's on like Red Dawn."

            <h1>Ready Player One</h1>
            <p>You land your spaceship (an exact replica of The Satellite of Love named "Nerdgasm") on the surface of Planet RP1. As you step through the hatch and onto the surface, you see a crowd of '80s people dressed in '80s clothes doing '80s things. You wonder if they are players or NPCs, but you're not sure and you don't really care. You push past them (not before pulling off several '80s dance moves), enter a squat building, and go down the stairs. At the bottom, you push open a door and enter...Aech's Basement! The coolest chat room anyone has ever seen. You feel like a flibbertigibbet as you survey the room and try to decide where the key could be hidden.
            <p>I-r0k is leaning against a shelf full of vintage role-playing game supplements. On the far wall, Aech is leaning against a closet door. Art3mis is sitting on the couch in the center of the room, watching TV.

                    <p>I-r0k is browsing IMDb, trying to memorize the actor lists from every John Hughes movie. He ignores you as you grab the Tomb of Horrors supplement off the top of the stack and start flipping pages. An object falls out of the book and into the shag carpet. You bend down and pick it up.

                    <p>Aech (pronounced "H") shimmers transparently as you approach, and you realize he's only present via chat link. You open the closet and find stacks upon stacks of weird tinned fish. On top of one stack, you find a Leopardon action figure. You shout its name: "Leopardon!"

Art3mis glares at you through several commercials advertising goods and workers, after which Family Ties starts. You realize you are watching Family Ties inside a text adventure game and instantly become depressed.

            <p>You arrive on Planet Moon Base, which looks exactly like the moon. You dock with the moon base and leave your ship, just like Major Bill Moore in the classic sci-fi film <i>Project Moon Base</i> (which was funded by the government as anti-alien propaganda). The door slides open, and after a pregnant pause, you step into the base. You glance around the structure and feel your face forming a goofy grin. 
            <p>You see Zack Lightman's parents; his insanely hot mom is covering her mouth with her very long fingers as she chuckles at a joke from her husband. You entered in the middle of the conversation, but you heard the punchline, "You're welcome." The two Mikes are in the corner watching Brady Bunch reruns. Lex is using a QComm, probably hacking but there's no way to know for sure. Major Graham Fogg and Major Shin are playing a song from the Raid the Arcade mixtape on their musical instruments to the delight of Atomic Mom, Wodie, Crazy G, and Milo.

                    <p>As you pass your eyes over the crates of junk food, you hear someone chuckle and turn. General Lightman says, "Care for some snackage? You're a Lucky Charms man, aren't you? Dry with no—" "I actually prefer Count Chocula," you interrupt. The general's face turns red with genuine embarassment. He scowls, gives a sarcastic two thumbs up, turns, and marches out of the room.
                    <p>You mutter, "Loser sewage worker," then turn back to the crates. As you do, you spot a miniature replica of a Glaive fighter out of the corner of your eye. You yell, "Glaive!"

                    <p>You start walking toward The Bishop of Battle when The Emissary appears out of nowhere. The many-sided shape (either an icosohedron or a dodecahedron) quickly explained the history of the video game industry, how it was secretly funded by the Europeans, and how it would lead to the complete happiness of the human race. (Fun fact: the voice was the voice of Ioan Gruffud, the Welsh actor who starred as Mr. Fantastic in the 2005 film <i>Fantastic Four</i>.) With a moonquake and the sound, "la loo la bah bah", it instantly disappears.
                    <p>You stop your head from nodding and look down at your hand. The Emissary has given you a key.

                    <p>As everyone watches silently, you swing the door open. Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Stephen Hawking enter the room together! A cheer slowly builds as they survey the room before turning to address the crowd.
                    <p>"I have decided that the moon would be the ideal place to start a new society," intones Neil DeGrasse Tyson. "A society called...'Rationalia'!"
                    <p>Everyone nods, except for Stephen Hawking. You nod, not in agreement, but to show you understand the reference.
                    <p>It's a long speech, like Matt Damon's in <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, and extremely annoying, like Matt Damon in <i>Good Will Hunting</i>.

            <h1>Trucking through Time</h1>
            <p>You bring your ship down onto Planet Wyoming Territory, near one of the many truck stops. Unfortunately you have to park across the street from the truck stop because there is no room anywhere else because of all the other spaceships.
            <p>You cross the street and push the door open. The truck stop restaurant is at the back of the truck stop, so you start walking to the back of the store, past the rows of tarps, bungie cords, fuzzies, binoculars, eye patches, jars of honey, used cowboy hats, Blue Dawn dishwashing liquid, pugil sticks, and coolers filled with knick knacks.
            <p>You make your way to an empty table, the only table in the place not occupied by real cowboys with real cowboy hats. As the waitress approaches, you turn your attention from the weatherman on the Weather Channel on the television; apparently thundersnow is expected the next day.
            <p>"Partner, I sure do like this tender meat. I would not have believed that I could enjoy any meat as much as I have this," yells a man at an adjacent table as he removes his hat.
            <p>"Would you like to order, hon, or do you need to see a menu?" asks the waitress.

The ????? story on the back of the menu (all menus in Wyoming have ????? stories on the back) tells about a bad day for the home team: two strangers that visited the area in olden times were caught in the middle of a bloody battle between the Indian and the white man. Neither of them survived.
                    <p>Every horrible thought comes into your mind.

Piece of cake, partner," says the waitress as she gestures west, left, south, right, left, and right with her hands.
                    <p>You follow her directions and arrive at Buffalo Gardens, which is like Jurassic Park for buffalo. The folksy robot at the gate hands you a key.

                    <p>"The Indian used them for torture. Sometimes castration, which was a form of torture. In their mind and beliefs, it was also a good spot to get engaged. We're not sure in what time period the Indian used this device; probably after Wyoming became a territory but before the US Census Bureau was formed."
                    <p>The waitress, disturbed, leaves the table. You also decide to leave, but not before purchasing an extra tarp.

            <h1>The Lair of the White Worm</h1>
            <p>You land your ship on Planet Diana's Grove. An old man greets you and wrings your hand heartily as you disembark.
            <p>"My boy, I have so been looking forward to seeing you. I have been dreaming of this happiness for thousands of miles!"
            <p>"Alright," you say weakly, unsure how to proceed.
            <p>"I have the whole day planned," continues the old man. "We shall start with a silent breakfast, or perhaps an early cup of tea amplified to the dimensions of a possible breakfast, followed by a visit to Doom Tower. Then, as President of the Mercian Archaeological Society, I must take you to the giant snake mounds. We shall, of course, wait until we are alone to discuss my theories on the matter over walnuts and wine—although perhaps it would be best to sleep on it, you watching me sleep—and discuss further plans. I hope that we may then dicuss British property law—" 
            <p>"I should like," you reply, "nothing better, but I am afraid I have urgent business. I must see a small animal merchant at once." 
            <p>When Ross hears your request, he asks, "Do you want something special, or will an ordinary mongoose do?"
            <p>"I think my current scenario calls for one of the most special variety."
            <p>Ross smiles and puts a long finger against his nose. He retreats to a back room before returning with three mongoose boxes, placing them on his counter and opening each in turn.
            <p>The first mongoose has thick black hair and black eyes impregnated with power.
            <p>The second mongoose is long, flexible, and white.
            <p>The third mongoose is enormous and is wearing a collar with a long leash attached.

Walking briskly, you crack open the box and find the creature staring at you with black, piercing eyes that are partly hypnotic, partly mesmeric. Oblivious to your surroundings, you slam into a well-hung door and fall to the ground unconscious.
                    <p>You awake in a bed, feeling like a hound's eye at rest. You suffered quite the head injury; it would have cost some—probably all—their lives in the Southern States of America. But to soften the blow, it appears that some well-wishers have left you with gifts: an earthen teapot, a slop basin, and a tank of fish born to destroy, to wound, to torture.

                    <p>As you hurry down the path through vast fens and quags, you hear snake charmer music coming out of a deep hole.
                    <p>You whisper to yourself, "I'm no Obi-man, but I know deep holes mean giant snakes." You edge to the edge of the hole and look down.
                    <p>At the bottom of the hole is a woman, or a giant white snake—it is impossible to tell which—with the strength and impregnability of a diplodocus. The antedivulian monster sways back and forth and beckons, inviting you to her turf. You accept, making it your turf!
                    <p>You drop the mongoose box and sprint back to town, then return to the hole with a sack of fine sea-sand, a Kelvin sounding apparatus, and a sufficient length of fine piano wire.
                    <p>You pour the sand down the hole; it trickles down the zone of slipperiness onto the Worm. You keep pouring until the only remaining sign of the antidiluvian monster is a dim green light.
                    <p>Physically "dog tired", you decide you had better go to bed. Under your pillow you find a key.
