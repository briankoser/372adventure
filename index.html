                <h1>Prologue</h1>
                <p>I put down my corn chips and scratched myself.
                <p>It's 2044, and I'm playing "The Oasis", the world's most popular online game. The creators named it after a game in a classic '10s book, <i>Ready Player One</i>. Like the game in the book, you can fly spaceships around and visit virtual planets containing everything imaginable. But the real game within the game is the monthly Hunt. Each month, the game designers choose a themed group of planets and hide a key on each one. Collect all the keys and you win.
                <p>This month's contest was about to start. I finished my corn chips and put down the bag. As I stared at the screen, the subject of the new Hunt faded in to visibility:
                <p>372 Pages We'll Never Get Back
                <p>What I can only describe as a Cheshire grin spread slowly over my face. Over the past few years, I had listened to every episode of the classic podcast eight times.
                <p>I watched every episode of the classic '80s show Mystery Science Theatre 3000, including the Netflix revival and the '30s VR series.
                <p>I continued to listen to Like Trees Walking, even after Dave Berge became a cyborg. 
                <p>I memorized every riff from every movie that Rifftrax ever riffed.
                <p>I read all 29 of Conor Lastowka's published novels several times each.
                <p>I convinced my drama teacher to let us put on "Ken Burns Babyfur" as a class play senior year.
                <p>I read every book on crows and every book on mockingbirds that my local library had on its shelves.
                <p>I obtained a copy of Animal Crackups and watched it every night before falling asleep.
                <p>I knew that Conor had appeared on Jeopardy, so I watched all 57 seasons of the show.
                <p>I watched every 372 Pages documentary.
                <p>I even listened to all of the side projects.
                <p>The grin remained spread across my face like The Joker in the 1989 film Batman, played by Jack Nicholson. I switched my microphone on and said, "N3lson, you ready for this?"
                <p>A voice seemed to crackle over my headset. "Lord N3lson to you, crapburger!"
                <p>I shook my head, still grinning. I had never met N3lson in real life, but I instinctively knew he looked exactly like his Oasis avatar. "That was completely uncalled for, lamer. And I will expect the same courtesy."
                <p>N3lson laughed. "Alright, Odgen. You ping Goat Roper, and I'll notify Biscuit Head and Pie Face. Ready the Jackals! Let's do this!"
                <p>We called ourselves The Four Score because there were originally four of us, and we like to collect high scores in all our games. We also called ourselves The Jackals.
                <p>"It's on," I whispered. "It's on like Red Dawn."

                <h1>Ready Player One</h1>
                <p>You land your spaceship (an exact replica of The Satellite of Love named "Nerdgasm") on the surface of Planet OASIS. As you step through the hatch and onto the surface, you see a crowd of '80s people dressed in '80s clothes doing '80s things. You wonder if they are players or NPCs, but you're not sure and you don't really care. You push past them, but not before pulling off several '80s dance moves. You can do literally anything in this virtual world, so you immediately make your way to the nearby squat building, enter, go down the stairs, push open a door and enter...Aech's Basement! The coolest chat room anyone has ever seen. You feel like a flibbertigibbet as you survey the room and try to decide where the key could be hidden.
                <p>I-r0k is leaning against a shelf full of vintage role-playing game supplements. On the far wall, Aech is leaning against a closet door. Art3mis is sitting on the couch in the center of the room, watching TV.

                        <p>Aech (pronounced "H") shimmers transparently as you approach, and you tumble to that he's only present via chat link. You open the closet and find stacks upon stacks of weird tinned fish. On top of one stack, you find a Leopardon action figure. You shout its name: "Leopardon!"

Art3mis glares at you through several commercials advertising goods and workers, after which Family Ties starts. You realize you are watching Family Ties inside a text adventure game and instantly become depressed.

                <p>You arrive on Planet Moon Base, which looks exactly like the moon. You dock with the moon base and leave your ship, just like Major Bill Moore in the classic sci-fi film <i>Project Moon Base</i> (which was funded by the government as anti-alien propaganda). The door slides open, and after a pregnant pause, you step into the base. You glance around the structure and feel your face forming a goofy grin.
                <p>You see Zack Lightman's parents; his insanely hot mom is covering her mouth with her very long fingers as she chuckles at a joke from her husband. You entered in the middle of the conversation, but you heard the punchline, "You're welcome." The two Mikes are in the corner watching Brady Bunch reruns. Lex is using a QComm, probably hacking but there's no way to know for sure. Major Graham Fogg and Major Shin are playing a song from the Raid the Arcade mixtape on their musical instruments to the delight of Atomic Mom, Wodie, Crazy G, and Milo.

                        <p>You start walking toward The Bishop of Battle when The Emissary appears out of nowhere. The many-sided shape (either an icosohedron or a dodecahedron) quickly explained the history of the video game industry, how it was secretly funded by the Europeans, and how it would lead to the complete happiness of the human race. (Fun fact: the voice was the voice of Doodles Weaver, who starred as "Giant Hobo" in an episode of the classic 1968 TV show <i>Land of the Giants</i>.) With a moonquake and the sound, "la loo la bah bah", it instantly disappears.
                        <p>You stop your head from nodding and look down at your hand. The Emissary has given you a key.

                        <p>As you pass your eyes over the crates of junk food, you hear someone chuckle and turn. General Lightman says, "Care for some snackage? You're a Lucky Charms man, aren't you? Dry with no—" "I actually prefer Count Chocula," you interrupt. The general's face turns red with genuine embarassment. He scowls, gives a sarcastic two thumbs up, turns, and marches out of the room.
                        <p>You mutter, "Loser sewage worker," then turn back to the crates. As you do, you spot a miniature replica of a Glaive fighter out of the corner of your eye. You yell, "Glaive!"

                        <p>As everyone watches silently, you swing the door open. Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Stephen Hawking enter the room together! A cheer slowly builds as they survey the room before turning to address the crowd.
                        <p>"I have decided that the moon would be the ideal place to start a new society," intones Neil DeGrasse Tyson. "A society called...'Rationalia'!"
                        <p>Everyone nods, except for Stephen Hawking. You nod, not in agreement, but to show you understand the reference.
                        <p>It's a long speech, like Matt Damon's in <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, and extremely annoying, like Matt Damon in <i>Good Will Hunting</i>.

                <p>Drunken thieves teem around complying wenches, and cuthroats proliferate, around faithless concubines.
                <p>You feel a pleas ant emotion as the warm air quickens through your g-string.

                        <p>You awake from your drunkeness in a stygmatic oubliette unable to tell if you are imprisoned in the vault of misery ten minutes or ten years, but estimating three days.
                        <p>Two temple shamen approach the postern of the pit. The acolytes of Argon blink their frog like eyes, their greasy lips pulled back into slobbering grins exposing black molars.

Agfnd blows fetid breath from his greasy arc and waves his projecting ape like arms, responding "Before me sirrah! Before me as always! HA, HA HA, HAAAA!"
                        <p>You reach the crest of the trench just as a brown hided rat the size of a weiner dog plummets out of the caligonous dusk nudging the acolyte into the pit. You take the opportunity to kick the lingerieng priest squarely, between the two testicles causing him to grab his urinary gland in irritation. His fetid ulations echo as he grovels in dejected misery. You hoist his mallet with engroved hand grip and escpate to the open air.
                        <h2>-3-</h2>
                        <p>Knowing where your steps are leading, you meander aimlessly. On a hand hewn altar you find the scozscict bauble...The eye of argon! As you raise the orb heaven ward it dribbles to the turf, into a slimy red ooze. "Oh! Kalla!" you whisper whimsicoracally.
                        <h2>The lost ending</h2>
                        <p>The ooze becomes a blotch, blotching things up. The blotch reveals the grim myster of life and becomes the likeness of a key.

                        <p>As the mortified solider gropes through the shadowed hell-pits of the Grim Reaper, your hair prickles yawkishly. Turning you become enclaved by the comrades of the sprawed warmonger.
                        <p>"Mrifk!" You dicker with the notion that you are in jeapardy as a cutlass sheathes into your entrails.

Disembarking, you step onto a moving walkway with waist-high plasguardrails. The walkway moves you past a trim young man holding the arm of a plump woman.
                <p>"Don't get too close to the edge, ma." The boy frowns. "That sure isn't," he complains, "a good idea with your vertigo."
                <p>"Gloriosky, Leroy, stop worrying."
                <p>After 30 seconds, the walkway ends. You know the best way to find the key here. You need to set up a meeting.

                        <p>You start to hail an aircab and climb into the back. The copper-colored robot driver drives in silence. At your destination you pay and get out. The metal man tips his sombrero, adjusts his multicolored serape, and drives off whistling "La Bamba".
                        <p>You commence climbing up the steps to the Cosmos Detective Agency office. Once inside you find Gomez's office.
                        <p>"This is, <i>amigo</i>, a pleasure," Gomez grins, his curly black hair looking especially lively. "What can I do for you?"
                        <p>"I need to meet with Beth Kittredge."
                        <p>Gomez pauses for five seconds, studying his booted feet, then looks up, his hair seeming to bounce. "Of course I can arrange it. My list of contacts has, if anything, ripened. But are you sure this idea is <i>bueno</i>, old boy?"
                        <p>You shrug one shoulder. "I only know it's what I have to do."
                        <p>The vidscreen takes thirty seconds to turn on, then freezes for another 50 seconds after you dial the number. The image of a woman appears in the exact center of the screen. It's Beth Kittredge.
                        <p>But it isn't Beth Kittredge. The simulacrum brushes at her hair.
                        <p>"Beth..."
                        <p>"I am, of course, an android replica of Beth Kittredge," Beth says. She was a pretty young woman, if you like them on the slender side.
                        <p>"Remind me not to fondle you," you murmur under your breath. "Beth...I need to meet with Sonny Hokori."
                        <p>The slim girl gives her head a negative shake. "Not a good idea."
                        <p>You raise a hand, as if you could reach out and touch her fakesilk sweatertunic. "Beth...it's important."
                        <p>Beth frowns but seems to relent. "Have you spoken with Bennet Sands?"
                        <p>You shake your head. After a few minutes of searching, she gives you the address of the Acapulco Ritz.
                        <p>You take a land cab. Entering the hotel, you start making your way to the lucite roulette tables. "Sonny Hokori," you accuse a plump, smiling Japanese. "What's a small time Tek dealer doing—"
                        <p>A ninja leaps out from behind a potted palm tree and slices Hokori in half. Removing her mask, the real Beth Kittredge presses something into your hand and sprints away. It's a key.

                        <p>You start toward the nearest skybus station. Climbing aboard the plasbottom tourist skybus, you take a seat near the window and watch a flock of sooty seagulls flit through the sunbright sky.
                        <p>You alight when the skybus stops in front of Power Chicken, a popular local rooster fightarena. You purchase a ticket, buy a box of Sands Biotech crackers, and commence climbing the stairs to the top of the amphitheatre. Reaching the top row of restbenches, you sit down next to a sweating fat man devouring a tray of nachos.
                        <p>"Globo," you state. Globo mops at the beads of perspiration covering his face and starts on a Monsanto-Frito pie.
                        <p>"<i>Si</i>," he whispers around a mouthful of chili, cheese, and soycorn chips.
                        <p>"I need to meet with Bennet Sands. That pale puffy SOB might be the key to this whole matter."
                        <p>Turning, slowly, the fat Globo finally meets your eyes, his own eyes bugging out almost to their limits. "If I rat on Sands, Sonny Hokori will make sure I never taste another <i>enchilada</i>." He loosens his collar, then moves his hands to his lap, temporarily forming a lump of fists before picking up a corn dog dipped in guacamole. "I could tell you where Winterguild can be found. Or set up a meeting with Warbride and Rafe Vargas."
                        <p>The bulbs of light at the top of the stadium flicker. You sigh. "Maybe I should just forget the whole thing and find a tek dealer," you say to yourself out loud. "How much do they charge for the nachos?"
                        <p>Globo shrugs his corpulent shoulders, his plascotton shirt dripping with excreted moisture. "Damn close to $35."

                        <p>You fly to a popular local bar, Tequila Mockingbird. You find a booth and wait for 37 minutes before a metal man made of chrome enters. He squeezes in to the seat across your table and eyes you steadily, steepling his chrome fingers under his chrome nose.
                        <p>"Winger, I need to set up a meeting with Warbride."
                        <p>He closes his silvery eyelids, then opens them. "I can, of course, arrange it. You should be aware that she is protecting herself with chimpanzee androids these days." He made his laughing sound.
                        <p>You stare quizically at the chrome Winger as he prints out Warbride's information from the printer in his hand in exactly 15 seconds. 
                        <p>The fuzzy sky is full of motion as you park your airvan on the side of the road. You start walking toward the platform where Warbride is giving her rally. She is surrounded by baskets of produce, apparently for propaganda.
                        <p>"Hey pal!" You turn and see Ogden Swires hurrying toward you. He falls in step as you continue toward the platform. "I'm writing a story about Warbride's place in worldwide business circles. You here to see Warbride or Rafe Vargas?"
                        <p>"I have business with the female android," you explain, pointing your thumb toward the platform.
                        <p>"Actually, Warbride is a cyborg. An android is a machine that looks like a man, like Winger. A cyborg is a person, a person that has had machine parts attached to their body."
                        <p>Warbride pounds her flesh hand into her metal hand to emphasize a rhetorical point. You proceed to the back of the platform and run into one of Warbride's android chimpanzee guards.
                        <p>"Password?" he growls.
                        <p>Glancing at the printout, you reply, "Piranha piranha," and push past the simian, leaving Swires behind.
                        <p>Reaching the top of the platform, you advance to Warbride. Assorted sounds of surprise and outrage emanate from the crowd as you begin a conversation with the half mech.
                        <p>"Are you in cahoots with Bennet Sands, Sonny Hokori, or both?"
                        <p>Warbride stares at you for a full 30 seconds, then gestures to one of her guards. The silver-plated beast clangs toward you.
                        <p>You look around and gesture weakly at the nearest bushel of fruit. "Banana?" you offer.
                        <p>He puts his metal hand on your shoulder. "Never touch the stuff," said the robot chimp disdainfully.

                <p>The 64-SQUARES skyscraper was blown to rubbish by the "cat burglar terrorist". It is not nice but it happened. But this 64-SQUARES skyscraper is a different skyscraper, a skyscraper that is untouched by four explosive ropes, or any other explosives. This 64-SQUARES skyscraper is in a video game. Video games, believe it or not, allow you to pretend that something is happening that did not really happen in real life. "Isn't technology great or what?"
                <p>Because of the attack by the "cat burglar terrorist", every 64-SQUARES employee will never be the same again. But with the power of video games, they can be the same again.
                <p>The board is set up for another case. This case is called The Forensic Certified Public Accountant and the Stolen or Misplaced Lucky Dixon Ticonderoga Pencil.

                        <p>Veronica Jackson, believe it or not, has some ideas about the possible location of the "Lucky" Dixon Ticonderoga pencil. When she worked for the president as one of his secretaries, she noticed that the Secretary of Commerce would sometimes put a pencil behind her ear and forget all about it. The Secretary of Health and Human Services tried to warm the Secretary of Commerce that she could contract lead poisoning, but the Secretary of Commerce would only joke about the matter.
                        <p>Veronica Jackson sets up an appointment with Sheriff Jack Starr, the CEO of 64-SQUARES, to determine if he has the pencil behind his ear. When I say that Veronica Jackson set up an appointment, it really is true.
                        <p>Sheriff Jack Starr, the CEO of 64-SQUARES, sent his powerful rësumë out after the 64-SQUARES skyscraper was reduced by a criminal, in this case the "cat burglar terrorist". But in a video game, all dreams are true, and Jack Starr is still the CEO of 64-SQUARES.
                        <p>Sheriff Jack Starr, CEO of 64-SQUARES, greets you with his catchphrase, "Who is the Sheriff of 64-SQUARES?" In this video game, he has a cowboy hat on, a suit, cowboy boots, and spurs on his boots. This is the same as real life. There is one difference from real life: he also has a star with "Sheriff Starr" printed on it. Wow. That is so great.
                        <p>This is a Tuesday. Veronica Jackson set up this appointment with Sheriff Jack Starr, CEO of 64-SQUARES, during the second of three breaks in his 2-hour meeting. A meeting inside a meeting? It is hard to believe, but it turns out to be true.
                        <p>"Sheriff Jack Starr, please check your ears for the missing Lucky Dixon Ticonderoga pencil."
                        <p>Sheriff Jack Starr puts his left hand on his left ear. He is left-handed, so it is a good first ear to check. Then, he puts his right hand on his right ear. Eureka! The "Lucky" Dixon Ticonderoga pencil!
                        <p>Sheriff Jack Starr, CEO of 64-SQUARES, put the pencil on his right ear and then forgot. Sheriff Jack Starr is six feet and three inches tall, so no one noticed the pencil on his ear.
                        <p>Sheriff Jack Starr, CEO of 64-SQUARES, hands you the "Lucky" Dixon Ticonderoga pencil, a key from his pocket, and a hearty handshake.
                        <p>This all could have been avoided if Belle Excel, the Executive Secretary of 64-SQUARES, had not left the pencil on Jack Starr's desk. Another case solved til the next case that is unsolved. My team and their always improving technology will be ready. We will pass the test with a passing grade.

                        <p>Deena Hope is working hard to hack Fort Knox. It is almost lunch time, but she is allowed to take an extra break to help you find information about the "Lucky" Dixon Ticonderoga pencil.
                        <p>Deena Hope hacks into the 64-SQUARES files to get a blueprint of the 64-SQUARES skyscraper. It could be the key to finding the "Lucky" Dixon Ticonderoga pencil.
                        <p>Of course the first two floors are where the chess museum is. That is knowledge known to the public.
                        <p>The third floor is where 64-SQUARES stores the secure data.
                        <p>The fourth floor is for inventions.
                        <p>The fifth floor is for private space plans.
                        <p>The sixth floor is for recipes for top-secret foods.
                        <p>The seventh floor is for computer programs, like Facebook and Yahoo.com.
                        <p>The eighth floor is storage for high technology, like drones to take pictures and cameras to take pictures, or ear hearing pieces.
                        <p>The ninth floor is for appraised bones such as dinosaurs.
                        <p>The tenth floor is for the offices of the human calculators, like Sue Christmas.
                        <p>The eleventh floor is for Xerox machines.
                        <p>The twelfth floor is for all quilting supplies.
                        <p>The thirteenth floor is for the Christian chapel. Some people consider thirteen to be an unlucky number, but the architect of the 64-SQUARES skyscraper, Rob Girder, is a Christian and does not believe in unlucky numbers. You will smile when I tell you that Rob Girder designed the thirteenth floor to be a Christian chapel. It is not a problem because there is no such thing as unlucky numbers.
                        <p>The fourteenth floor is rented by The Dutchman Insurance, Inc.
                        <p>The fifteenth through seventeenth floors are a penthouse suite owned by the Battletoads.
                        <p>The eighteenth floor is Ken Beatrice's office.
                        <p>The nineteenth floor is an Arby's.
                        <p>The twentieth floor is bathrooms without cameras.
                        <p>The twenty-first floor is where 64-SQUARES stores the human-size chess board on the days it is not used.
                        <p>I think you have the picture in your mind. It is as fun to look at the blueprints as it is to sneak checkers into a chess museum, but it does not tell you the location of the "Lucky" Dixon Ticonderoga pencil. But Deena Hope teaches you a few hacking tricks, so was it worth it? Yes, absolutely.

                        <p>Drew Sampson is a sad man. Drew Sampson has a wife, ???? Sampson, but she now lives her mother. ????? Sampson thinks that Drew Sampson spends too much time on the weekends listening to recordings from his office bugs. It is good that Drew Sampson has this job so that he can pay for his children to do the activities, but he has not had time recently to make it to see the activities. Drew Sampson thinks that after he finds the "Lucky" Dixon Ticonderoga pencil he will take some time off from work and everything will be better.
                        <p>Drew Sampson listens to all of the 64-SQUARES bugs and hears that the international jewel thief and motivational calendar writer, Ruby Tuesday, may have information about the "Lucky" Dixon Ticonderoga pencil. Ruby Tuesday will be in court the same day as Clef Treble, who is guilty of terrorism of a building, in this "case", the 64-SQUARES skyscraper, and guilty of terrorism against the whole world. Well, well, well.
                        <p>Ruby Tuesday is waiting in line for her turn while Clef Treble is on trial. Judge Moses Gavel is sick today, so his brother, Judge Aaron Gavel, who also went to judge school, is in charge. He will decide if 64-SQUARES can rebuild their skyscraper.
                        <p>Judge Aaron Gavel bangs his hammer-thing for order, order in the court. You are sitting in the court next to Drew Sampson, Chuck Mack, Spider Webb, Davey Bond, Super Vision, and Quick Swift.
                        <p>Judge Aaron Gavel asks Clef Treble to swear to make no material misstatements on a stack of Bibles. Instead, Clef Treble pushes the stack of Bibles over and pulls a gun out of his pocket! Before he can threaten the court, Clef Treble receives a bullet wound in his right shoulder. Clef Treble falls to the ground, spurting blood from his shoulder wound and vomiting blood from his internal bleeding.
                        <p>You turn and see Quick Swift standing up with a smoking gun in his hand. "Quick is not short for Quicken or Quickbooks," says Quick Swift. "It is short for Quickdraw."
                        <p>That is cool. That is so realistic.
                        <p>But while the court was distracted, Ruby Tuesday vanished without a trace. The trail of the "Lucky" Dixon Ticonderoga pencil is cold.

                <p>You bring your ship down onto Planet Wyoming Territory, near one of the many truck stops. Unfortunately you have to park across the street from the truck stop because there is no room anywhere else because of all the other spaceships.
                <p>You cross the street and push the door open. The truck stop restaurant is at the back of the truck stop, so you start walking to the back of the store, past the rows of tarps, bungie cords, fuzzies, binoculars, eye patches, jars of honey, used cowboy hats, Blue Dawn dishwashing liquid, pugil sticks, and coolers filled with knick knacks.
                <p>You make your way to an empty table, the only table in the place not occupied by real cowboys with real cowboy hats. As the waitress approaches, you turn your attention from the weatherman on the Weather Channel on the television; apparently thundersnow is expected the next day.
                <p>"Partner, I sure do like this tender meat. I would not have believed that I could enjoy any meat as much as I have this," yells a man at an adjacent table as he removes his hat.
                <p>"Would you like to order, hon, or do you need to see a menu?" asks the waitress.

Piece of cake, partner," says the waitress as she gestures west, left, south, right, left, and right with her hands.
                        <p>You follow her directions and arrive at Buffalo Gardens, which is like Jurassic Park for buffalo. The folksy robot at the gate hands you a key.

                        <p>"The Indian used them for torture. Sometimes castration, which was a form of torture. In their mind and beliefs, it was also a good spot to get engaged. We're not sure in what time period the Indian used this device; probably after Wyoming became a territory but before the US Census Bureau was formed."
                        <p>The waitress, disturbed, leaves the table. You also decide to leave, but not before purchasing an extra tarp.

This menu tells about a bad day for the home team: two strangers visited the area in olden times and were caught in the middle of a bloody battle between the Indian and the white man. Neither of them survived.

                <h1>The Lair of the White Worm</h1>
                <p>You land your ship on Planet Diana's Grove. An old man greets you and wrings your hand heartily as you disembark.
                <p>"My boy, I have so been looking forward to seeing you. I have been dreaming of this happiness for thousands of miles!"
                <p>"Alright," you say weakly, unsure how to proceed.
                <p>"I have the whole day planned," continues the old man. "We shall start with a silent breakfast, or perhaps an early cup of tea amplified to the dimensions of a possible breakfast, followed by a visit to Doom Tower. Then, as President of the Mercian Archaeological Society, I must take you to the giant snake mounds. We shall, of course, wait until we are alone to discuss my theories on the matter over walnuts and wine—although perhaps it would be best to sleep on it, you watching me sleep—and discuss further plans. I hope that we may then dicuss British property law—" 
                <p>"I should like," you reply, "nothing better, but I am afraid I have urgent business. I must see a small animal merchant at once." 
                <p>When Ross hears your request, he asks, "Do you want something special, or will an ordinary mongoose do?"
                <p>"I think my current scenario calls for one of the most special variety."
                <p>Ross smiles and puts a long finger against his nose. He retreats to a back room before returning with three mongoose boxes, placing them on his counter and opening each in turn.
                <p>The first mongoose has thick black hair and black eyes impregnated with power.
                <p>The second mongoose is long, flexible, and white.
                <p>The third mongoose is enormous and is wearing a collar with a long leash attached.

Walking briskly, you crack open the box and find the creature staring at you with black, piercing eyes that are partly hypnotic, partly mesmeric. Oblivious to your surroundings, you slam into a well-hung door and fall to the ground unconscious.
                        <p>You awake in a bed, feeling like a hound's eye at rest. You suffered quite the head injury; it would have cost some—probably all—their lives in the Southern States of America. But to soften the blow, it appears that some well-wishers have left you with gifts: an earthen teapot, a slop basin, and a tank of fish born to destroy, to wound, to torture.

                        <p>You whisper to yourself, "I'm no Obi-man, but I know deep holes mean giant snakes." You edge to the edge of the hole and look down.
                        <p>At the bottom of the hole is a woman, or a giant white snake—it is impossible to tell which—with the strength and impregnability of a diplodocus. The antedivulian monster sways back and forth and beckons, inviting you to her turf. You accept, making it your turf!
                        <p>You drop the mongoose box and sprint back to town, then return to the hole with a sack of fine sea-sand, a Kelvin sounding apparatus, and a sufficient length of fine piano wire.
                        <p>You pour the sand down the hole; it trickles down the zone of slipperiness onto the Worm. You keep pouring until the only remaining sign of the antidiluvian monster is a dim green light.
                        <p>Physically "dog tired", you decide you had better go to bed. Under your pillow you find a key.

            <p>To celebrate the <a href="http://372pages.com/">372 Pages We'll Never Get back</a> podcast finishing their 10th book, I present this 372 Pages fan-fiction role-playing game. It seemed fitting to write a story by ripping off other stories and filling up on references.
            <h1>Thanks</h1>
            <p>Thanks Conor and Mike for the podcast. It's become one of our favorite bits of media to consume together.
            <p>Thanks to the <a href="http://tableflipsyou.com">Flip the Table podcast</a>; the format of 372 Adventure is an adaptation of one of their recurring games. Aptly, Flip the Table was inspired in part by Mystery Science Theatre 3000. (The hosts riff on cheesy, weird, and obscure board games, then conclude with a game show. The podcast has ended, but I highly recommend listening through the archive; start with <a href="https://tableflipsyou.blogspot.com/2012/10/episode-13-gone-birding.html">Gone Birding!</a> or <a href="https://tableflipsyou.blogspot.com/2014/02/episode-48-mcdonalds-game.html">The McDonald's Game</a>.)
            <p>Thanks to my wife and podcast cohost Melissa, who contributed a bunch of suggestions, especially for <i>The Lair of the White Worm</i>.
            <p>Thanks to Ben De Bono of <a href="http://thescifichristian.com">The Sci-Fi Christian</a>, who turned us on to 372 Pages in the <i>Ready Player One</i> days.
            <p>And to Conor again, who <a href="http://372pages.com/episodes/372pages_008.mp3#t=01:19:47">once said</a>, <q>There's value in creating something that is more than just reciting things that came before it, or telling people what you like.</q>... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

            <p><img src="author.jpg" alt="Portrait of the author">Brian Koser is a <a href="https://github.com/briankoser">computer programmer</a>, a <a href="https://tto.koser.us">podcaster</a>, and a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4812558-brian-koser">reader</a>. Brian Koser is a little proud that he has <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2883909057">the highest-rated review of <i>Trucking through Time</i> on Goodreads</a>. Brian Koser is a little less proud that his review of <i>Trucking through Time</i> on Goodreads is the most popular book review that he has written on Goodreads. Brian Koser has a wife Melissa Koser. Melissa Koser is also a podcaster and a reader. Melissa Koser likes to visit Brian Koser at the office. Brian Koser and Melissa Koser met in the college library. On the day they met they were reading books at the same table. They stayed at the table for a whole hour. Brian said to Melissa, we could read a book together forever. Melissa said, of course I will marry you Brian Koser. Brian Koser and Melissa Koser have three good daughters: Lydia, Amber, and Penelope. Lydia, Amber, and Penelope are good sisters. It is so good when a sister is nice to another sister, and then that sister is, nice to a sister. Thus nice goes around in a circle, a circle of nice.</p>
