            <h1>Prologue</h1>
            <p>I put down my corn chips and scratched myself.
            <p>It's 2044, and I'm playing "The Oasis", the world's most popular online game. The creators named it after a game in a classic '10s book, <i>Ready Player One</i>. Like the game in the book, you can fly spaceships around and visit virtual planets containing everything imaginable. But the real game within the game is the monthly Hunt. Each month, the game designers choose a themed group of planets and hide a key on each one. Collect all the keys and you win.
            <p>This month's contest was about to start. I finished my corn chips and put down the bag. As I stared at the screen, the subject of the new Hunt faded in to visibility:
            <p>372 Pages We'll Never Get Back
            <p>What I can only describe as a Cheshire grin spread slowly over my face. Over the past few years, I had listened to every episode of the classic podcast eight times.
            <p>I watched every episode of the classic '80s show Mystery Science Theatre 3000, including the Netflix revival and the '30s VR series.
            <p>I continued to listen to Like Trees Walking, even after Dave Berge became a cyborg. 
            <p>I memorized every riff from every movie that Rifftrax ever riffed.
            <p>I read all 29 of Conor Lastowka's published novels several times each.
            <p>I knew that Conor had appeared on Jeopardy, so I watched all 57 seasons of the show.
            <p>I convinced my drama teacher to let us put on "Ken Burns Babyfur" as a class play senior year.
            <p>I read every book on crows and every book on mockingbirds that my local library had on its shelves.
            <p>I obtained a copy of Animal Crackups and watched it every night before falling asleep.
            <p>I watched every 372 Pages documentary.
            <p>I even listened to all of the side projects.
            <p>The grin remained spread across my face like The Joker in the 1989 film Batman, played by Jack Nicholson. I switched my microphone on and said, "N3lson, you ready for this?"
            <p>A voice seemed to crackle over my headset. "Lord N3lson to you, crapburger!"
            <p>I shook my head, still grinning. I had never met N3lson in real life, but I instinctively knew he looked exactly like his Oasis avatar. "That was completely uncalled for, lamer. And I will expect the same courtesy."
            <p>N3lson laughed. "Alright, Odgen. You ping Goat Roper, and I'll notify Biscuit Head and Pie Face. Ready the Jackals! Let's do this!"
            <p>We called ourselves The Four Score because there were originally four of us, and we like to collect high scores in all our games. We also called ourselves The Jackals.
            <p>"It's on," I whispered. "It's on like Red Dawn."

            <h1>Ready Player One</h1>
            <p>You land your spaceship (an exact replica of The Satellite of Love named "Nerdgasm") on the surface of Planet OASIS. As you step through the hatch and onto the surface, you see a crowd of '80s people dressed in '80s clothes doing '80s things. You wonder if they are players or NPCs, but you're not sure and you don't really care. You push past them, but not before pulling off several '80s dance moves. You can do literally anything in this virtual world, so you immediately make your way to the nearby squat building, enter, go down the stairs, push open a door and enter...Aech's Basement! The coolest chat room anyone has ever seen. You feel like a flibbertigibbet as you survey the room and try to decide where the key could be hidden.
            <p>I-r0k is leaning against a shelf full of vintage role-playing game supplements. On the far wall, Aech is leaning against a closet door. Art3mis is sitting on the couch in the center of the room, watching TV.

He ignores you as you grab the Tomb of Horrors supplement off the top of the stack and start flipping pages. An object falls out of the book and into the shag carpet. You bend down and pick it up.

Art3mis glares at you through several commercials advertising goods and workers, after which Family Ties starts. You realize you are watching Family Ties inside a text adventure game and instantly become depressed.

            <p>You arrive on Planet Moon Base, which looks exactly like the moon. You dock with the moon base and leave your ship, just like Major Bill Moore in the classic sci-fi film <i>Project Moon Base</i> (which was funded by the government as anti-alien propaganda). The door slides open, and after a pregnant pause, you step into the base. You glance around the structure and feel your face forming a goofy grin.
            <p>You see Zack Lightman's parents; his insanely hot mom is covering her mouth with her very long fingers as she chuckles at a joke from her husband. You entered in the middle of the conversation, but you heard the punchline, "You're welcome." The two Mikes are in the corner watching Brady Bunch reruns. Lex is using a QComm, probably hacking but there's no way to know for sure. Major Graham Fogg and Major Shin are playing a song from the Raid the Arcade mixtape on their musical instruments to the delight of Atomic Mom, Wodie, Crazy G, and Milo.

                    <p>You start walking toward The Bishop of Battle when The Emissary appears out of nowhere. The many-sided shape (either an icosohedron or a dodecahedron) quickly explained the history of the video game industry, how it was secretly funded by the Europeans, and how it would lead to the complete happiness of the human race. (Fun fact: the voice was the voice of Doodles Weaver, who starred as "Giant Hobo" in an episode of the classic 1968 TV show <i>Land of the Giants</i>.) With a moonquake and the sound, "la loo la bah bah", it instantly disappears.
                    <p>You stop your head from nodding and look down at your hand. The Emissary has given you a key.

Dry with no—" "I actually prefer Count Chocula," you interrupt. The general's face turns red with genuine embarassment. He scowls, gives a sarcastic two thumbs up, turns, and marches out of the room.
                    <p>You mutter, "Loser sewage worker," then turn back to the crates. As you do, you spot a miniature replica of a Glaive fighter out of the corner of your eye. You yell, "Glaive!"

                    <p>As everyone watches silently, you swing the door open. Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Stephen Hawking enter the room together! A cheer slowly builds as they survey the room before turning to address the crowd.
                    <p>"I have decided that the moon would be the ideal place to start a new society," intones Neil DeGrasse Tyson. "A society called...'Rationalia'!"
                    <p>Everyone nods, except for Stephen Hawking. You nod, not in agreement, but to show you understand the reference.
                    <p>It's a long speech, like Matt Damon's in <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, and extremely annoying, like Matt Damon in <i>Good Will Hunting</i>.

                    <p>Two temple shamen approach the postern of the pit. The acolytes of Argon blink their frog like eyes, their greasy lips pulled back into slobbering grins exposing black molars.

His fetid ulations echo as he grovels in dejected misery. You hoist his mallet with engroved hand grip and escpate to the open air.

                    <p>"This is, <i>amigo</i>, a pleasure," Gomez grins, his curly black hair looking especially lively. "What can I do for you?"

                    <p>You shake your head. After a few minutes of searching, she gives you the address of the Acapulco Ritz.
                    <p>You take a land cab. Entering the hotel, you start making your way to the lucite roulette tables. "Sonny Hokori," you accuse a plump, smiling Japanese. "What's a small time Tek dealer doing—"
                    <p>A ninja leaps out from behind a potted palm tree and slices Hokori in half. Removing her mask, the real Beth Kittredge presses something into your hand and sprints away. You examine the piece of fakeplas, which is roughly the size of an average cockroach.

                    <p>"Globo," you state. Globo mops at the beads of perspiration covering his face and starts on a Monsanto-Frito pie.
                    <p>"<i>Si</i>," he whispers around a mouthful of chili, cheese, and soycorn chips.
                    <p>"I need to meet with Bennet Sands. That pale puffy SOB might be the key to this whole matter."
                    <p>Turning, slowly, the fat Globo finally meets your eyes, his own eyes bugging out almost to their limits. "If I rat on Sands, Sonny Hokori will make sure I never taste another <i>enchilada</i>." He loosens his collar, then moves his hands to his lap, temporarily forming a lump of fists before picking up a corn dog dipped in guacamole. "I could tell you where Winterguild can be found. Or set up a meeting with Warbride and Rafe Vargas."
                    <p>The bulbs of light at the top of the stadium flicker. You sigh. "Maybe I should just forget the whole thing and find a tek dealer," you say to yourself out loud. "How much do they charge for the nachos?"
                    <p>Globo shrugs his corpulent shoulders, his plascotton shirt dripping with excreted moisture. "Damn close to $35."
                    <p>You make your way down to the concession stands, getting in line behind a husky woman and a skinny boy of seventeen.
                    <p>"Do you want popcorn, Ogden?"
                    <p>"I told you, maw. Inkblack licorice and a beer."
                    <p>You buy the plazbox of nachos. They're pretty good.

                    <p>You start towards the nearest sky cruiser rental.
                    <p>"All we've got today is airvans, bud," says the bald employee, rubbing his smooth pate.
                    <p>You fly to a popular local bar, Tequila Mockingbird. You find a booth and wait for 37 minutes before a metal man made of chrome enters. He squeezes in to the seat across your table and eyes you steadily, steepling his chrome fingers under his chrome nose.
                    <p>"Winger, I need to set up a meeting with Warbride."
                    <p>He closes his silvery eyelids, then opens them. "I can, of course, arrange it. You should be aware that she is protecting herself with chimpanzee androids these days." He made his laughing sound.
                    <p>You stare quizically at the chrome Winger as he prints out Warbride's information from the printer in his hand in exactly 15 seconds. 
                    <p>The fuzzy sky is full of motion as you park your airvan on the side of the road. You start walking toward the platform where Warbride is giving her rally. She is surrounded by baskets of produce, apparently for propaganda.
                    <p>"Hey pal!" You turn and see Ogden Swires hurrying toward you. He falls in step as you continue toward the platform. "I'm writing a story about Warbride's place in worldwide business circles. You here to see Warbride or Rafe Vargas?"
                    <p>"I have business with the female android," you explain, pointing your thumb toward the platform.
                    <p>"Actually, Warbride is a cyborg. An android is a machine that looks like a man, like Winger. A cyborg is a person, a person that has had machine parts attached to their body."
                    <p>Warbride pounds her flesh hand into her metal hand to emphasize a rhetorical point. You proceed to the back of the platform and run into one of Warbride's android chimpanzee guards.
                    <p>"Password?" he growls.
                    <p>Glancing at the printout, you reply, "Piranha piranha," and push past the simian, leaving Swires behind.
                    <p>Reaching the top of the platform, you advance to Warbride. Assorted sounds of surprise and outrage emanate from the crowd as you begin a conversation with the half mech.
                    <p>"Are you in cahoots with Bennet Sands, Sonny Hokori, or both?"
                    <p>Warbride stares at you for a full 30 seconds, then gestures to one of her guards. The silver-plated beast clangs toward you.
                    <p>You look around and gesture weakly at the nearest bushel of fruit. "Banana?" you offer.
                    <p>He puts his metal hand on your shoulder. "Never touch the stuff," said the robot chimp disdainfully.

        # The Forensic Certified Public Accountant and the Cremated 64-SQUARES Financial Statements
Titles repeated every time
No pronouns
Not much plot

Definition of cash flow statements
This financial statement is fun, because the final cash amount is the cash amount on the closing date of the financial accounting period. 
Four sentences in a row that starts with a characters name. 
Tell about their family
Sneaking checkers into the chess museum
Corporate booths: ring toss. Shooting the basketball, grilled food available to sell, dunk the person
Human chess
Appraised bones such as Dinosaurs. 
That is a very long quote, but it is correct
What did you say? 
Sheriff jack Starr, ceo, cowboy hat, suit, spurs on boots, John Wayne, Dallas cowboys, who is the Sheriff of 64-Squares?, surprised that he doesn't have a star with Sheriff star printed on it 
2 hour meetings with 3 breaks
What do you think they talked about? Of course they talked about 64-Squares business. 
Org chart 
Pam Valentine got the best test score in the minimum amount of time, possibly the best cpa of all time 
Everyone is a great cpa, or is studying to be a cpa, or wants to be a cpa
There were no nominations so they all went home. Ha ha just kidding. There were nominations. 
The new skyscraper will be bomb proof
Or it would be six months, yes six months, before she could... 
That is so realistic. 
Rosie o'neal has the friendliest voice
The janitor would notice anything strange (in that, there was something there that should not be there, or there was something missing that should be there.) 
Drawing a gun for no apparent reason 
People who are eating get so relaxed that their voices talk louder than normal and they give away secrets. 
Inventions, private space plans, recipes, computer programs
Cat burglar terrorists always in quotes
Four explosive ropes from roof to all 64 stories
Clef treble, guilty of terrorism of a building
No, farther questions your honor. 
Board terminated Jack Starr, he sent his powerful resume out
64-Squares changed name to Phoenix
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada
He decided to blow it up because he was banned from the building. Nobody likes to be told what to do, like not visiting their girlfriend at the office. It is legal for people to be mean. This all could have been avoided if people were nice to each other. Checkmate. Another case solved. Til the next case that is Unsolved. My team and their spy equipment will be ready. Set up the board for another case. 
The criminal, or in this case, the terrorist



The voice inside of me told me... 
At church, everyone helps each other so that everyone can be the best person that they can be by helping others that need help. 
Nice produces nice. 
Food in my stomach because I am hungry
The xerox repairman
It will be important to not waste time
Previous case was card counting
It was hard to believe, but it turned out to be true
Quilt criminal (-- guilty) 
Wow 
A picture is worth a thousand words. That statement is so true. 
If the suspect is in one location, then that means they cannot be in another location. 
Case of the missing mascot
That is cool. That is so realistic. 
Everyone wants to be a cpa
Chess museum
Attorney sharp hatchet 
Lay witness
Quick swift (short for quicken or quick books). Dreamed of becoming singer, but the supply of singers was greater than the demand for singers in Nashville. Married Sue swift the day he met her. Of course I will marry you quick swift. Insurance adjusting gave him the satisfaction of providing for his family. 
Sorry, back to the case. 
Vancouver fire and rescue

Mickey keys, math whisperer 
Spinner Jones
Material misstatements 
Eating a stack of Oscar Mayer deli turkey with a fork and knife
Cat burglars and terrorists interrogated until the interrogators are satisfied with their answers
The timing of the explosion will never be the same again
Whenever a building is blown up, it is considered a terrorist attack against the whole world, not just against the country or town where the explosion happened. 
Very displeased with 64-Squares 
Computer program opened all the safes so the contents would also be destroyed

Pam valentine, Peter Graham, clef treble
Peter wanted clear sailing to marry Pam, spied on her, knew everything she did
Cameras in bathrooms
Any business can give criminal trespass and can tell them what to do. That makes me sick.

            <p>"Alright," you say weakly, unsure how to proceed.
            <p>"I have the whole day planned," continues the old man. "We shall start with a silent breakfast, or perhaps an early cup of tea amplified to the dimensions of a possible breakfast, followed by a visit to Doom Tower. Then, as President of the Mercian Archaeological Society, I must take you to the giant snake mounds. We shall, of course, wait until we are alone to discuss my theories on the matter over walnuts and wine—although perhaps it would be best to sleep on it, you watching me sleep—and discuss further plans. I hope that we may then dicuss British property law—"

            <p>Ross smiles and puts a long finger against his nose. He retreats to a back room before returning with three mongoose boxes, placing them on his counter and opening each in turn.

Walking briskly, you crack open the box and find the creature staring at you with black, piercing eyes that are partly hypnotic, partly mesmeric. Oblivious to your surroundings, you slam into a well-hung door and fall to the ground unconscious.
                    <p>You awake in a bed, feeling like a hound's eye at rest. You suffered quite the head injury; it would have cost some—probably all—their lives in the Southern States of America. But to soften the blow, it appears that some well-wishers have left you with gifts: an earthen teapot, a slop basin, and a tank of fish born to destroy, to wound, to torture.

                    <p>You carry off the white mongoose, thinking of nothing but worm taxonomy and the well-known legends of the Worm of Lambton and the Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh.
                    <p>As you hurry down the path through vast fens and quags, you hear snake charmer music coming out of a deep hole.
                    <p>You whisper to yourself, "I'm no Obi-man, but I know deep holes mean giant snakes." You edge to the edge of the hole and look down.
                    <p>At the bottom of the hole is a woman, or a giant white snake—it is impossible to tell which—with the strength and impregnability of a diplodocus. The antedivulian monster sways back and forth and beckons, inviting you to her turf. You accept, making it your turf!
                    <p>You drop the mongoose box and sprint back to town, then return to the hole with a sack of fine sea-sand, a Kelvin sounding apparatus, and a sufficient length of fine piano wire.
                    <p>You pour the sand down the hole; it trickles down the zone of slipperiness onto the Worm. You keep pouring until the only remaining sign of the antidiluvian monster is a dim green light.
                    <p>Physically "dog tired", you decide you had better go to bed. Under your pillow you find a key.

The annual migration of African pigeons begins! Runners and statues of Egyptian gods are sent up the kite, but all efforts are unavailing.

            <p>Wade Watts and Zack Lightman are playing video games on Nintendo 2DS handheld game devices.
            <p>Grignr is standing at the bar, pounding his tankard and yelling for an innkeeper.

            <p>Titus Uno, Certified Public Accountant, Forensic Certified Public Accountant, and Global Chartered Management Accountant, is cutting up a stack of Oscar Mayer deli turkey with a knife and fork and staring at you with a grin.

            <p>Maxim Trevelyan is pouring beer deftly into a glass (this guy really is a lord!).

            <p>You stand frozen for 20 seconds, then reach into your pocket and pull out the keys. "Oh! Kalla!" The keys start glowing, then reshape themselves into cylinders. You stare at them for a minute, then move your hand to your hip and unholster your blaster pistol, an exact replica of the BlasTech DL-44 carried by Han Solo in the classic '80s film franchise Star Wars. You deftly insert the cartridges into the chamber and raise the blaster, pointing it briefly at each other person in the room.
